## **Core Platform Features**

### **User Registration & Profile Management**

#### **Survivor Registration**

Survivors can join the platform with complete anonymity protection. The registration process uses progressive disclosure, allowing users to share information gradually as trust develops. No personal details are required initially \- users can begin with just a username and secure access method.

The platform offers multiple privacy options including disguised app functionality, panic logout features that instantly clear all session data, and quick exit options that redirect to neutral websites. Survivors maintain complete control over their information sharing, with granular privacy settings that determine what information is visible to different user types.

#### **Professional Verification & Profiles**

All professionals undergo rigorous verification including credential validation, license verification, and background screening. Professional profiles include detailed information about specializations, trauma-informed care training, cultural competencies, language abilities, and specific areas of expertise.

Professionals can indicate their availability in real-time, set their service areas, specify their preferred communication methods, and highlight any specialized training in areas like LGBTQ+ support, cultural sensitivity, or specific trauma types. This detailed profiling enables precise matching with survivors' needs.

#### **Safety Planning Integration**

The platform includes collaborative safety planning tools where survivors can work with professionals to create personalized safety strategies. These plans are encrypted and accessible only to the survivor and their chosen support team, with options for emergency sharing with trusted contacts.

### **Incident Reporting & Documentation**

#### **Comprehensive Reporting System**

The incident reporting feature uses trauma-informed design principles with gentle, non-invasive prompts that guide survivors through documenting their experiences. The interface supports multiple input methods including text descriptions, voice recordings, photographs, and video evidence.

Reports can be saved as drafts, allowing survivors to complete documentation at their own pace without pressure. The system automatically captures metadata when permitted, including timestamps and location data, while maintaining complete anonymization of the survivor's identity.

#### **Evidence Management**

Survivors can securely upload various forms of evidence including images, audio recordings, and video files. All uploaded content is encrypted and timestamped with immutable logging for potential legal proceedings. The platform maintains chain of custody documentation while protecting survivor anonymity.

The system supports progressive evidence sharing, where survivors can choose to share different levels of detail with different professionals. For instance, they might share basic incident information with a counselor while providing detailed evidence to a legal professional.

#### **Report Classification**

Reports are automatically categorized based on content to ensure appropriate professional matching. The system identifies urgency levels ranging from immediate danger situations to ongoing support needs, enabling rapid response for emergency situations while providing thoughtful matching for long-term support needs.

### **Professional Matching System**

#### **Intelligent Matching Algorithm**

The platform's matching system considers multiple factors to connect survivors with the most appropriate professionals. Primary matching criteria include the type of service needed (legal, medical, counseling, emergency shelter), geographic accessibility, professional availability, and urgency level of the situation.

Secondary matching factors include survivor preferences for professional demographics, language requirements, cultural background alignment, and specific expertise areas. The system also considers historical success rates and professional response times to optimize matches.

#### **Multi-Professional Coordination**

Survivors often need multiple types of support simultaneously. The platform facilitates coordination between different professionals, allowing seamless referrals and communication between legal advocates, counselors, medical professionals, and social workers while maintaining survivor privacy and control.

#### **Quality Assurance & Feedback**

The matching system continuously improves through anonymous feedback from both survivors and professionals. Success rates are tracked, response times are monitored, and match quality is assessed to refine the algorithm over time. Professionals who consistently receive positive feedback and demonstrate effective support are prioritized in future matches.
