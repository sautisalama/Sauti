### **What we do**

**Access to Care and Support**  
We strengthen pathways to psychosocial support, legal information, and emergency response so that women and girls can seek help safely and with dignity.

**Community Organising and Prevention**  
We work with young people, caregivers, and community actors to build collective responsibility, reduce isolation, and prevent violence.

**Legal Access and Advocacy**  
We improve access to justice through legal literacy, survivor navigation, and advocacy grounded in lived experience.

**Feminist Technology and Digital Infrastructure**  
We design and maintain digital tools that expand access to care and information while prioritising consent, safety, and accountability.

### **Why we exist**

Gender-based violence is not only about individual acts of harm.  
It is shaped by silence, distance from services, fear of retaliation, cost, stigma, and systems that fail to respond.

Sauti Salama exists to reduce these barriers and to ensure that support is reachable, coordinated, and grounded in care.

# **ABOUT SAUTI SALAMA**

### **Who we are**

Sauti Salama is a Kenyan feminist organisation founded in response to gaps in access to care, safety, and justice for women and girls. Our work emerged from community organising and survivor support, where it became clear that many people are expected to navigate harm alone.

We are led by young women and youth, and our work is shaped by survivor-informed practice, accountability, and community trust.

---

### **Our values**

**Care as a collective responsibility**  
Care is central to justice and community resilience.

**Consent within systems**  
Safety requires consent to be built into institutions, tools, and processes, not placed solely on individuals.

**Accountability over visibility**  
We prioritise responsible practice, safeguarding, and learning over public recognition.

**Community before tools**  
Technology supports community-led response; it does not replace it.

---

### **Our approach**

We work across community organising, digital access, and institutional engagement to strengthen survivor-centred response systems. We recognise that existing systems are often fragmented or inaccessible, and we work to bridge these gaps while advocating for structural change.

Our approach is feminist, practical, and grounded in lived realities.

# **OUR WORK**

## **Access to Care and Support**

We support women and girls to access psychosocial care, justice information, and referral pathways. Our work prioritises confidentiality, choice, and dignity. We focus on reducing harm and increasing access rather than controlling outcomes.

---

## **Community Organising and Prevention**

Violence thrives in isolation. We work with youth, caregivers, and community leaders to strengthen local response networks, encourage shared responsibility, and support prevention rooted in care and accountability.

---

## **Legal Access and Advocacy**

Access to justice is shaped by information, support, and trust. We work to improve legal literacy, navigation, and survivor accompaniment, and we engage in advocacy informed by community experience.

---

## **Feminist Technology and Digital Infrastructure**

We develop and maintain digital tools that support access to information, reporting options, and care pathways. Our technology work centres consent, data protection, and survivor safety, and is guided by ongoing community feedback.

---

# **CLIMATE, CARE, AND KIWU**

Climate shocks intensify existing inequalities and increase risks of violence. Water scarcity, energy poverty, displacement, and unsafe movement place disproportionate burdens on women and girls.

Kiwu is Sauti Salama’s climate and care initiative that responds to these realities through practical, low-cost infrastructure that supports safety, dignity, and resilience in climate-vulnerable communities.

For Sauti Salama, climate resilience is inseparable from care and protection.

# **THE SAUTI SALAMA DIGITAL PLATFORM**

We are transparent about the platform’s scope and limitations and prioritise continuous improvement and safeguarding.

# **PARTNERS AND NETWORKS**

We collaborate with community-based organisations, legal actors, health providers, youth networks, and regional and global coalitions. Our partnerships are built on shared values, clarity of roles, and mutual accountability.
