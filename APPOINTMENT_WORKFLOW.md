# Sauti Appointment System: Complete Workflow Guide

This document explains how the appointment system works in Sauti, from the moment a survivor creates a report to scheduling and managing appointments with professionals.

## üìã Overview

The Sauti appointment system creates a seamless flow connecting survivors who need help with professionals who can provide support. The system includes automated matching, professional scheduling, and comprehensive appointment management.

## üîÑ Complete Workflow

### 1. **Report Creation** (Survivor Side)

**What happens when a survivor creates a report:**

1. **Survivor fills out abuse report** through the authenticated report form
   - Incident details, urgency level, required services
   - Contact preferences and consent information
   - Location data (if consent given)

2. **Report is saved to database** with status `pending`
   - Assigned unique `report_id`
   - Marked as `ismatched: false`
   - Status set to `match_status: pending`

3. **Automatic service matching begins**
   - System runs matching algorithm (`matchReportWithServices()`)
   - Finds professionals with relevant support services
   - Creates entries in `matched_services` table

---

### 2. **Service Matching** (Automated Process)

**How the system connects survivors with professionals:**

```
Report Created ‚Üí Matching Algorithm ‚Üí Matched Services ‚Üí Professional Notifications
```

1. **Algorithm analyzes report:**
   - Incident type (domestic_violence, sexual_assault, etc.)
   - Required services (counseling, legal_aid, medical, etc.)
   - Location/proximity (if location sharing enabled)
   - Urgency level (high, medium, low)

2. **Finds compatible professionals:**
   - Professionals with matching `service_types`
   - Active support services in the database
   - Geographic proximity (if applicable)

3. **Creates match records:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO matched_services (
     report_id,
     service_id,
     match_status_type: 'pending',
     match_score
   )
   ```

4. **Professionals receive notifications** about potential matches

---

### 3. **Professional Review** (Professional Side)

**How professionals evaluate and respond to matches:**

1. **Professional views match in dashboard:**
   - **Cases Tab** shows pending matches
   - Can see anonymized report details
   - Incident description and required services
   - Urgency indicators and match score

2. **Professional can take actions:**
   - ‚úÖ **Accept** - Agree to help this survivor
   - ‚ùå **Decline** - Not able to help (with optional reason)
   - üìù **Request more info** - Need clarification before deciding

3. **When professional accepts:**
   - Match status changes to `accepted`
   - Report status changes to `accepted`
   - Report marked as `ismatched: true`
   - **Appointment scheduling becomes available**

     duration_minutes,
     status: 'confirmed',
     created_via: 'dashboard'
   )
   ```
